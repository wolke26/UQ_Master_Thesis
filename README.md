# UQ_Master_Thesis

In this project you can find some ingredients to sample Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Random fields (Beta, Gamma, Uniform, Logarithmic).
This code was used for my Master Thesis to analyse Uncertainty Quantification of Convolutiona of Arterial Wall Simulations with Neural Networks which was conducted at Graz University of Technology in 2020-2021. 
If you are interested in different sampling methods of Random Fields (Gaussian and Non-Gaussian) please feel free to reach out to me anytime.

Moreover, the results of this work will be published in a paper (link to hopefully follow) for which some sample snippets might be of use as well.

The Deep Bayesian Encoder Decoder Network is based on the work "Bayesian deep convolutional encoderâ€“decoder networks for surrogate modeling and uncertainty quantification" done by Zhu & Zabaras 2018 and can be found here https://github.com/cics-nd/cnn-surrogate , as well as the paper "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118302341".

For personal use an adapted clone of their work is uploaded in this folder as well.
